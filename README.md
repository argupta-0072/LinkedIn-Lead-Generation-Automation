## üìñ Overview

Manually searching, connecting, and messaging potential leads on LinkedIn is a repetitive and time-consuming task. This project was created to automate these actions in a human-like manner to avoid detection. The script leverages Selenium to control a web browser, navigating LinkedIn's interface to perform tasks based on user-defined search criteria.

**The primary goal is to build a targeted lead list efficiently, allowing you to focus on building relationships rather than on manual prospecting.**

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üéØ Targeted Search:** Automatically searches for profiles based on keywords like job title, company, industry, and location.
- **ü§ù Automated Connections:** Sends personalized connection requests. You can use message templates with placeholders (e.g., `{firstName}`, `{jobTitle}`) for a personal touch.
- ** scrapping Profile Scraping:** Extracts key information from profiles, such as name, job title, company, and location.
- **‚úçÔ∏è Automated Messaging:** Sends customized follow-up messages to new connections after a specified delay.
- **üìä Data Export:** Saves all collected lead data into a structured format (e.g., CSV or Excel) for easy integration with CRM systems or further analysis.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Configurable & Customizable:** Easily configure search parameters, message templates, and automation speed through a simple config file.
- **üß† Human-like Behavior:** Incorporates random delays and realistic actions to minimize the risk of account suspension.

## üîß How It Works

The script operates by launching a browser instance controlled by **Selenium WebDriver**. It then performs the following steps:

1.  **Login:** Securely logs into your LinkedIn account using credentials stored in an environment file.
2.  **Search:** Navigates to the search page and inputs the criteria defined in the configuration file.
3.  **Iterate & Connect:** Scans through the search results, page by page. For each profile that is not yet a connection, it visits the profile, clicks the "Connect" button, and pastes a personalized message.
4.  **Data Extraction:** As it processes each profile, it scrapes relevant data.
5.  **Save Progress:** The collected data is appended to a CSV file in real-time.
6.  **Logout & Close:** Once the process is complete or the target number of connections is sent, it safely logs out and closes the browser.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This script is intended for educational and research purposes only. Automating interactions on LinkedIn is against their User Agreement and can result in a temporary or permanent ban of your account. **Use this tool at your own risk.**

The developers of this project are not responsible for any consequences of its use. It is highly recommended to use this script with a test account and to implement conservative settings (long delays, limited daily actions) to minimize risk.

## üöÄ Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.8+
- Google Chrome (or another supported browser)
- Git

**1. Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourUsername]/[YourRepoName].git
cd [YourRepoName]
```

**2. Create a Virtual Environment:**
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**3. Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Download WebDriver:**
Download the appropriate [WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/install_drivers/) for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome) and place it in the project's root directory or ensure it's in your system's PATH.

**5. Configure Environment Variables:**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the example file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Now, open the `.env` file and add your LinkedIn credentials:
```
LINKEDIN_EMAIL="your_email@example.com"
LINKEDIN_PASSWORD="your_super_secret_password"
```

## üèÉ Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can run the script from the terminal.

**1. Customize Configuration:**
Open `config.json` (or your config file) and set your search parameters and message templates.
```json
{
  "search_keywords": "Software Engineer in Test",
  "location": "India",
  "connection_message": "Hi {firstName}, I came across your profile and was impressed by your experience at {companyName}. I'd love to connect and learn more about your work.",
  "max_connections_to_send": 50
}
```

**2. Run the Main Script:**
```bash
python main.py
```
The script will now launch the browser and begin the automation process. You can watch its progress in the terminal.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

The `config.json` file allows you to control the bot's behavior without editing the code. Key parameters include:

- `search_keywords`: The job title or keywords to search for.
- `location`: The geographical location to target.
- `connection_message`: The template for your connection request message.
- `max_connections_to_send`: A limit to prevent sending too many requests in one session.
- `delay_settings`: Min/max values for random delays between actions.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- [ ] **GUI Implementation:** Develop a simple graphical user interface using Tkinter or PyQT for easier use by non-developers.
- [ ] **Proxy Support:** Add proxy rotation to reduce the risk of IP-based blocking.
- [ ] **Advanced AI Messaging:** Integrate a language model (like GPT) to generate more dynamic and context-aware messages.
- [ ] **Dashboard:** Create a simple dashboard to visualize collected lead data and automation stats.
- [ ] **Dockerization:** Package the application into a Docker container for easy deployment.
